[Development Still ongoing]


Fitguide V2 is an exercise application that utilizes machine learning to determine the correctness of the exercises that have been executed. Users can train their exercise model through data generation with the help of Pose Estimation and trained in RNN-LSTM architecture. Another capability of the user is to manage Workouts, they may compile sets of exercises into one and be able to share it with other users.

**[Purpose & Goals]**
 - 


**[Technologies used]**
- **TensorFlow & TFLite**: Pose estimation, model training, and inference.
- **WebSocket**: Model training progress tracking.
- **Optuna**: Hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models.
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile application.
- **Django**: Backend framework for API and business logic.

**[Features]**
 - Real-time human action recognition
 - Streamlined data generation and model training
 - Fully customizable exercises and workouts
 - Progress Tracking
 - Content Sharing

**[Future features]** 
- Gamified exercise utilizing pose estimation
- Very long sequences of actions (dances)
- Real-time training
