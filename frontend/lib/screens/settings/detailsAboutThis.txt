Settings will contain:
- different color theme presets 
- different option for inferencing(performing exercise)
        -inferencing mode(utilizes AI)
            - disables video
            - disables inferencing (counting will still occur but will only look at the last frame)[really hassle to pull off, needs configuration on the backend side specifically training part]
            - enable showing skeleton(user would have to rely on the error indicator whether the user is in frame)
        
        -normal mode(user will just press a button to indicate exercise is done)
